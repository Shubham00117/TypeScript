DAY 12 - INHERITANCE AND METHOD OVERRIDING

Concepts Covered:
- Class inheritance: extends keyword
- Parent class (base class)
- Child class (derived class)
- Super keyword: call parent constructor/method
- Method overriding: override keyword
- Protected access modifier
- Multiple child classes from one parent
- Polymorphism

Key Points:
- Inheritance allows code reuse
- Child class inherits parent properties and methods
- Super() calls parent constructor
- Override keyword replaces parent method
- Protected allows child class access
- One parent can have multiple children
- Polymorphism: same interface, different implementations
- Common pattern: BasePage with child page classes
