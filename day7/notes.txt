DAY 7 - LOOPING STATEMENTS

Concepts Covered:
- For loop: known iterations
- While loop: condition checked first
- Do-while loop: executes at least once
- For...of loop: iterate arrays
- For...in loop: iterate object keys
- Array forEach: execute function for each element
- Break: exit loop
- Continue: skip current iteration

Key Points:
- For loop: for(init; condition; increment)
- While checks condition before execution
- Do-while checks condition after execution
- For...of is preferred for arrays
- For...in iterates object properties
- Break stops entire loop
- Continue skips to next iteration
- Most used in automation: for...of, forEach
