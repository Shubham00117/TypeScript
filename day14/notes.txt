DAY 14 - MODULES AND EXPORTS

Concepts Covered:
- Export keyword: export class/interface/function
- Import keyword: import { } from "path"
- Module structure
- Exporting classes
- Exporting interfaces
- Exporting functions
- Importing from different folders
- Relative paths: ../, ./
- Page Object Model structure
- Test organization

Key Points:
- Export makes code available to other files
- Import brings code from other files
- Use relative paths for local imports
- ../ goes up one folder level
- ./ refers to current folder
- Organize code into folders: models, pages, tests, utils
- Models: data structures (interfaces)
- Pages: page objects (classes)
- Tests: test files
- Utils: helper functions
- Common pattern: Page Object Model with modules

Files:
- models/UserModel.ts: Data model interface
- pages/AuthPage.ts: Authentication page class
- pages/dashBoardPage.ts: Dashboard page class
- tests/LoginTest.ts: Test file with imports
- utils/TestHelper.ts: Utility functions
