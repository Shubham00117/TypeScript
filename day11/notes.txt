DAY 11 - CLASSES AND OBJECTS

Concepts Covered:
- Class definition
- Properties (variables in class)
- Constructor (initialization)
- Methods (functions in class)
- Object creation: new ClassName()
- Accessing methods: object.method()
- Access modifiers: public, private, protected
- Async methods in class
- Page Object Model pattern

Key Points:
- Class is blueprint for objects
- Constructor runs when object is created
- Methods define class behavior
- Public: accessible everywhere (default)
- Private: accessible only in class
- Protected: accessible in class and child classes
- Page Object Model organizes page elements and actions
- Most used in automation: classes for page objects
