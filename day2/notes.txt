DAY 2 - VARIABLES: VAR, LET, CONST

Concepts Covered:
- VAR: Function-scoped, allows redeclaration
- LET: Block-scoped, allows reassignment
- CONST: Block-scoped, no reassignment
- Scope differences between var, let, const
- Object mutation with const

Key Points:
- VAR is function-scoped (accessible throughout function)
- LET is block-scoped (accessible only in block)
- CONST prevents reassignment but allows object property changes
- Prefer LET and CONST over VAR in modern TypeScript
